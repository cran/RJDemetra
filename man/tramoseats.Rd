\arguments{
\item{series}{a univariate time series}

\item{spec}{model specification TRAMO-SEATS. For the function:
\itemize{
\item \code{tramoseats}, object of class \code{c("SA_spec","TRAMO_SEATS")}
\item \code{tramoseats_def}, predefined TRAMO-SEATS 'JDemetra+' model specification (see \emph{Details}). The default is "RSAfull".
}}

\item{userdefined}{vector with characters for additional output variables (see \code{\link{user_defined_variables}}).}
}
\value{
\code{tramoseats}/\code{tramoseats_def} returns an object of class \code{c("SA","TRAMO_SEATS")}, a list containing the following components:

\item{regarima}{object of class \code{c("regarima","TRAMO_SEATS")}. See \emph{Value} of the function \code{\link{regarima}}.}

\item{decomposition}{object of class \code{"decomposition_SEATS"}, five elements list:
\itemize{
\item \code{specification} list with the SEATS algorithm specification. See also function \code{\link{tramoseats_spec}}
\item \code{mode} decomposition mode
\item \code{model} list with the SEATS models: \code{model, sa, trend, seasonal, transitory, irregular}. Each of them is a matrix with the estimated coefficients.
\item \code{linearized} time series matrix (mts) with the stochastic series decomposition (input series \code{y_lin}, seasonally adjusted \code{sa_lin}, trend \code{t_lin}, seasonal \code{s_lin}, irregular \code{i_lin})
\item \code{components} time series matrix (mts) with the decomposition components (input series \code{y_cmp}, seasonally adjusted \code{sa_cmp}, trend \code{t_cmp}, seasonal \code{s_cmp}, irregular \code{i_cmp})
}
}

\item{final}{object of class \code{c("final","mts","ts","matrix")}. Matrix with the final results of the seasonal adjustment.
It includes time series: original time series (\code{y}), forecast of the original series (\code{y_f}), trend (\code{t}), forecast of the trend (\code{t_f}),
seasonally adjusted series (\code{sa}), forecast of the seasonally adjusted series (\code{sa_f}),
seasonal component (\code{s}), forecast of the seasonal component (\code{s_f}), irregular component (\code{i}) and the forecast of the irregular component (\code{i_f}).}

\item{diagnostics}{object of class \code{"diagnostics"}, list with three type of diagnostics tests:
\itemize{
\item \code{variance_decomposition} data.frame with the tests on the relative contribution of the components to the stationary portion of the variance in the original series, after the removal of the long term trend.
\item \code{residuals_test} data.frame with the tests on the presence of seasonality in the residuals (includes the statistic, p-value and parameters description)
\item \code{combined_test}  combined tests for stable seasonality in the entire series. Two elements list with: \code{tests_for_stable_seasonality} - data.frame with the tests (includes the statistic, p-value and parameters description) and \code{combined_seasonality_test} - the summary.
}
}
}
\description{
\code{tramoseats}/\code{tramoseats_def} estimates the seasonally adjusted series (sa) with the TRAMO-SEATS method.
This is achieved by decomposing the time series (y) into the: trend-cycle (t), seasonal component (s) and irregular component (i).
The final seasonally adjusted series shall be free of seasonal and calendar-related movements.
}
\details{
The first step of the seasonal adjustment consist of pre-adjusting the time series by removing from it the deterministic effects by means of a regression model with ARIMA noise (RegARIMA, see: \code{\link{regarima}}).
In the second part, the pre-adjusted series is decomposed into the following components: trend-cycle (t), seasonal component (s) and irregular component (i). The decomposition can be: additive  (\eqn{y = t + s + i}) or multiplicative (\eqn{y = t * s * i}). The final seasonally adjusted series (sa) shall be free of seasonal and calendar-related movements.

In the TRAMO-SEATS method, the second step - SEATS ("Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series") - performs an ARIMA-based decomposition of an observed time series into unobserved components. More information on the method can be found on the Bank of Spian website (\url{www.bde.es}).

As regards the available predefined 'JDemetra+' TRAMO-SEATS model specifications (for the function \code{tramoseats_def}), they are described in the table below.
